## 🔍 About

As a seasoned cybersecurity analyst, I created HawkEyeSec to serve two main purposes:

1. **Knowledge sharing** – Tools, workflows, and write-ups to help analysts, incident responders, and threat hunters.
2. **Human side of cyber** – Exploring topics like burnout, stress, and resilience in the security industry.
